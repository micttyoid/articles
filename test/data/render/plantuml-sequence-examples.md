# Test data: PlantUML - Sequence examples

## Sequence: declaring participants

**Syntax**

```plantuml
@startuml
participant Participant as Foo
actor       Actor       as Foo1
boundary    Boundary    as Foo2
control     Control     as Foo3
entity      Entity      as Foo4
database    Database    as Foo5
collections Collections as Foo6
queue       Queue       as Foo7
Foo -> Foo1 : To actor 
Foo -> Foo2 : To boundary
Foo -> Foo3 : To control
Foo -> Foo4 : To entity
Foo -> Foo5 : To database
Foo -> Foo6 : To collections
Foo -> Foo7: To queue
@enduml
```

**Render**

```[plantuml]
@startuml
participant Participant as Foo
actor       Actor       as Foo1
boundary    Boundary    as Foo2
control     Control     as Foo3
entity      Entity      as Foo4
database    Database    as Foo5
collections Collections as Foo6
queue       Queue       as Foo7
Foo -> Foo1 : To actor 
Foo -> Foo2 : To boundary
Foo -> Foo3 : To control
Foo -> Foo4 : To entity
Foo -> Foo5 : To database
Foo -> Foo6 : To collections
Foo -> Foo7: To queue
@enduml
```

## Sequence: message sequence numbering

**Syntax**

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber 10 10 "<b>[000]"
Bob -> Alice : Authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Authentication Response

autonumber stop
Bob -> Alice : dummy

autonumber resume "<font color=red><b>Message 0  "
Bob -> Alice : Yet another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Yet another authentication Response

autonumber stop
Bob -> Alice : dummy

autonumber resume 1 "<font color=blue><b>Message 0  "
Bob -> Alice : Yet another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Yet another authentication Response
@enduml
```

**Render**

```[plantuml]
@startuml
autonumber 10 10 "<b>[000]"
Bob -> Alice : Authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Authentication Response

autonumber stop
Bob -> Alice : dummy

autonumber resume "<font color=red><b>Message 0  "
Bob -> Alice : Yet another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Yet another authentication Response

autonumber stop
Bob -> Alice : dummy

autonumber resume 1 "<font color=blue><b>Message 0  "
Bob -> Alice : Yet another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Yet another authentication Response
@enduml
```

## Sequence: lifeline activation and destruction

**Syntax**

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User

User -> A: DoWork
activate A

A -> B: << createRequest >>
activate B

B -> C: DoWork
activate C
C --> B: WorkDone
destroy C

B --> A: RequestCreated
deactivate B

A -> User: Done
deactivate A

@enduml
```

**Render**

```[plantuml]
@startuml
participant User

User -> A: DoWork
activate A

A -> B: << createRequest >>
activate B

B -> C: DoWork
activate C
C --> B: WorkDone
destroy C

B --> A: RequestCreated
deactivate B

A -> User: Done
deactivate A

@enduml
```
